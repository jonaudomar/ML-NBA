# Welcome to my data science project using machine learning on NBA's players data

## About the dataset

The dataset contains statistics of 4000 NBA players, including:

- `season` : The season (yearly) the player played in
- `poss` : Possessions played
- `mp` : Minutes played
- `do_ratio` : A player’s ratio of time spent in defense vs. offense; negative values mean more defense positioning
- `pacing` : Player impact on team possessions per 48 minutes
- `win_rating` : Wins Above Replacement rating, how many additional wins a player is worth over a same-level replacement

## About the project

### [Part 1 : Working on the linear model](https://github.com/jonaudomar/ML-NBA/blob/main/Linear_Regression-Copy1.ipynb)

The goal of the project is to model the relationship between the players’ win rating and the amount of minutes they played.

Along the way, we are going to :

- Visualize the relationship between the win rating, minutes played, and other statistics
- Evaluate a Linear Regression model using K-Fold cross-validation
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Visualize the trained model
- Use the model to predict new data

### [Part 2 : Working on the Learning curves](https://github.com/jonaudomar/ML-NBA/blob/main/Learning_Curves-Copy1.ipynb)

The goal of this part in to interpret the learning curves and understanding how model complexity affects the results and how we can prevent underfitting and overfitting.

We are going to cover theses topics :

- Learning Curves
- Bias
- Variance
- Polynomial Features
- Necessary training size
